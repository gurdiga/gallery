This is a link to an `nginx` auto-indexed folder:

<a gallery href="https://sandradodd.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/Europe/France/Leon%20Photos/">https://sandradodd.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/Europe/France/Leon Photos/</a>

If you add a `gallery` attribute to it, you get this one:

<a gallery href="https://sandradodd.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/Europe/France/Leon%20Photos/">Click me to see the magic!</a>
