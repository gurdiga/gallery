# gallery

A photo gallery widget for websites.

## How to use

Include the `gallery.js` script somewhere in the page:

```html
<script async src="gallery.js"></script>
```

If you have any `<a gallery href="https://some/nginx/folder/with/photos">` tags, they will be enchanted to open a slide-show of photos in that folder.
